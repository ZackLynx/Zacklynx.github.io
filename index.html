        During the Summer 2023 semester at St. Charles Community College, I lead a team of four
        in creating a full-stack web application that helped users manage their passwords. My
        coding responsibility was to create an ancryption algorith to secure the data from
        would-be hackers.

        This project was developed for a PHP/MySQL class in the Spring 2025 semester at St. Charles
        Community College. I was the sole developer on this project which spanned 2 months. THe goal
        was to create a system that allowed a user to manage multiple character sheets for the
        Pathfinder tabletop roleplaying game.
